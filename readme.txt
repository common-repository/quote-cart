== Description ==

Works like a shopping cart where visitors add products but instead of a checkout there is a widget display form where the visitor enters details and clicks 'request quote' and all the products they choose and their details get sent to a designated email address. Perfect for sites where the site owner just wants to correspond through email before any sale is made. Products can be entered into a post via shortcode or through inserting a PHP function into the loop. Go to settings > quote cart to view these codes. All Quote requests are stored in a table which is visible at settings > quote requests also.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `quote-cart.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to settings > quotes to view shortcode and PHP function for inserting products into your site
4. Go to settings > quotes to configure general settings such as email recipient etc
5. Place "quote-cart" widget in a place you would like it to be viewed in your site. (quote cart widget only appears when visitor clicks on a product)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

What will be the product title that appears when a visitor clicks "add to quote"?

If the add to quote link exists due to PHP Function the title of the post will be the title that appears in the widget display. If the link exists due to shortcode then the title that will appear will be determined in the shortcode. For both the shortcode and php function go to settings > quote cart


Why Cant I see the Widget Display?

It only appears when the quote cart widget has been placed into your site and it also only appears when a visitor clicks on an "add to quote' link within the site.


How do I insert an "add to quote" link in my site?

Once you have the plugin installed you can either insert a link through shortcode found in settings > quote cart or through PHP function through settings > quote cart
